# Sample Generation

This is the automatic sample generation flow. 
Before running this flow, make sure that the feature extraction flow is properly executed.

## How to use?
Try the following code for a simple demo: 

      python sample_generation.py atax --prj_dir ../../dataset/benchmark/target/atax/generated --pwr_dir ../../dataset/benchmark/target/atax --out_dir ./graph_sample

   Check the generated Pytorch samples in the following folder: `./graph_sample`
